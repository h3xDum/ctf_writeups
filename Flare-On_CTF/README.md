# Flare-On 11 challenge 1: frog

This Challange We are faced with a 
basic file tree for a pygame application  

* frog.exe &rarr; frog.py compiled
* frog.py  &rarr; source code  
* fonts/   &rarr; game assets  
* img/     &rarr; game assets  
* README &rarr; installation instructions  

Runing the game we are greeted by a little frog maze, the frog  
is located at the top left corener and we can move it around via  
the typical "asdw" keys
